Primitive type is a type of data that represents a single value. In other words, it is not a object.

There are 6 primitive types in JavaScript

1. undefined
2. null: null represents lack of existence. You can set a variable to this
3. boolean: true or false
4. number: floating point number(there is always some decimals). There is only 1 number type in JavaScript
5. string: a sequence of characters(both '' and "" can be used)
6. symbol(available in ES6)
